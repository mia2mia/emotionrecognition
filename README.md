# speech-emotion-recognition
This repo contains the implementation of the paper "Automatic Speech Emotion Recognition using RNN with Local Attention"

The training data needs to be in a folder called dataset. Download the dataset from: https://docs.lighting.com/:u:/g/personal/deep_chakraborty_lighting_com/ESTNoXziobxIotdX_ZF4cFEBbN9bb-aljGNm9pErYfptNA?e=0mmoSk

The models will be saved in a folder called models.

Usage for now:
```shell
python model.py
```
